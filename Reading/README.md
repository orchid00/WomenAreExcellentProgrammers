# Women are excellent Programmers

To inspire you and make you think about this statement, I am gathering a few online and freely accessible reads. 

* The Secret history of Women in Coding. By Clive Thompson. Feb. 13, 2019. The New York Times Magazine https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html
Notes: This read links to many other awesome reads, it moved to many preconceived ideas in me.
* A Woman's Story, Mar. 29, 2012. http://braythwayt.com/posterous/2012/03/29/a-womans-story.html
Notes: "The computer didn't care that I was a woman or that I was black" My favourite line.

* Grace Murray Hopper. The Compiler, MIT. https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/grace-murray-hopper Notes: She is so clever and witty.
